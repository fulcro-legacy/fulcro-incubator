  - `will-enter` for the routes will *not* get a reconciler (since there
  isn't one).  Be sure your routers will tolerate a nil reconciler.
  - This has not been well-tested.  It is known to render correct HTML in simple cases, but the initial state
  may not actually be correct for the starting app with respect to the routers.
